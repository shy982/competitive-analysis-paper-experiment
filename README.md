# Catboost-vs-Lightboost-vs-XGBoost-vs-Snapboost

A comparison of 4 boosting algorithm on various datasets

The inspiration for categorical dataset was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/asgharm1999/pokemon-classification/execution

The inspiration for image dataset was taken from https://setscholars.net/2020/03/30/image-classification-using-catboost-an-example-in-python-using-cifar10-dataset/

The inspiration of numeric dataset was taken from https://towardsdatascience.com/become-a-pok%C3%A9mon-master-with-machine-learning-f61686542ef1

The inspiration of temporal dataset was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/paulbrabban/daily-minimum-temperatures-in-melbourne
